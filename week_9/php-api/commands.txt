To run this PHP file, you need to have a PHP server running. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Ensure PHP is installed**:
  - Open a terminal and type `php -v` to check if PHP is installed. If not, install PHP based on your operating system.

2. **Navigate to the file's directory**:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/ramadugudhanush/Documents/WSE/WSE\ lab/week_9/php-api/
  ```

3. **Start a PHP built-in server**:
  Run the following command to start a PHP server:
  ```bash
  php -S localhost:8000
  ```

4. **Access the file in your browser**:
  Open your browser and go to:
  ```
  http://localhost:8000/session.php
  ```

This will execute the PHP file and display the JSON response.
